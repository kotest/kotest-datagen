Data producers for use in tests (or in your applications) that produce either randomized generated data (eg stock prices), or randomly selected values from existing datasets (brand names).
Many producers take real data sets and combine them in random ways to increase the number of samples. For example, first and last name producers are based on real datasets, but full name producers combine these in a random way.
